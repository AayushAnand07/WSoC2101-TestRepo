                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
                  The project aims to develop a platform for all the students of VIT-AP to look for the recently upcoming and currently active events happening in the university.
                  The students will be able to find a short description of an active event, get the required links for event registration, manage the events they registered for and review about the event after it is completed.
                  <br> 
                  The admins, i.e. the club admin members and college admin ( if selected as a university project) will be able to track the expected audience set by the organising club,
                  success bar of the event ( as in how much of the expected population actually participated in the event), see the student reviews.
                  This will also help to track the most successful events organised in the university and best responded events by the students.
