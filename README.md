# Development of a platform for students and college admin to administer the college clubs and events.

## Project Description
- The project aims to develop a platform for all the students of VIT-AP to look for the recently upcoming and currently active events happening in the university. The students will be able to find a short description of an active event, get the required links for event registration, manage the events they registered for and review about the event after it is completed.

- The admins, i.e. the club admin members and college admin ( if selected as an university project) will be able to track the expected audience set by the organising club, success bar of the event ( as in how much of the expected population actually participated in the event), see the student reviews. This will also help to track the most successful events organised in the university and best responded events by the students.

## Why is this Project needed?
Let’s begin with questioning the experience we have/had to participate in the events happening in the university :
-	We receive quite a plenty of emails daily, of which we need to filter the mails for the organised events ( which is never one at a time, plenty of them are organised simultaneously or one after other) which leads to a spam of emails among various other information passed by the university. Too much chaos, isn’t it?

-	Once we finally find and star mark the upcoming event info we received, we have to wait for any further update and spend a lot of concentration on that one particular event info mail from the university admin or join the whatsapp groups or discord channels for each individual event for every small update. 
I have been to 15 such different groups and channels already , disorganised again. 

-	Okay, now we are up for the event but wait, I registered for two events on the same timeline. Now what do I do? Which one to go for, hassle.
I wish i could easily compare the timelines of the two more easily before registration.

-	Now, the event is complete, I loved the way it was organised. How do I pass my feedback and compliments to the organising committee and let the university admin know too, that it was one of its kind event?
No way, but just to wait for any feedback form ( if any) from the organising clubs.
Again another email to look for, never mind i won’t give my feedback.  

	###Hereby, the event is complete for the students, but what about the club members and the university admin? A lot of post event questions are:

1.)	For the club EB :
-	How well was the event organised, we shall take reviews from the participants?  Make and circulate a feedback form. 
-	Shut down the groups or discord channels made for the participants FAQ’s. New ones would be made for further events.
-	Record the stats of the participation and keep it to our database.


2.)	For the university admin:
-	 Was the event successful? Was the organising committee able to attract the expected population?
-	How well are the clubs organising events? Which club is able to organise the most successful events.
Most awards for the clubs are solely distributed by the number of events organised by the clubs and the creativity of their event, but not on how well it was organised and responded by the participants. 
Also, some technical clubs do have their individual platforms for recording the participation and attendendances, but many others don’t, especially non-technical ones. And why individual platforms when one can do it for all? 

Hence, We cover these pitfalls in the events organisation in the university.
This project focuses to improve the events management process for the students and post event tracking for the college and club admin department.
It will also let the student post their queries for the event, and the clubs can update FAQs regarding their event for better understanding of the participants.
It provides the feature of short reviews from the participants post event and rate it for the club to administer how their event went and keep improving with time, by addressing the issues faced by the participants (if any).
Also, it would let the university admin track the working and progress of clubs in the university.
This project holds the potential to turn around the whole event organisation/registration process in the university, and improve the participation of students according to their interests and understanding.
