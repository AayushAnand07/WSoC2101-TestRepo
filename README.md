# Development of a platform for students and college admin to administer the college clubs and events.

## Project Description

- The project aims to develop a platform for all the students of VIT-AP to look for the recently upcoming and currently
  active events happening in the university. The students will be able to find a short description of an active event,
  get the required links for event registration, manage the events they registered for and review about the event after
  it is completed.

- The admins, i.e. the club admin members and college admin ( if selected as an university project) will be able to
  track the expected audience set by the organising club, success bar of the event ( as in how much of the expected
  population actually participated in the event), see the student reviews. This will also help to track the most
  successful events organised in the university and best responded events by the students.

## Why is this Project needed?

Let’s begin with questioning the experience we have/had to participate in the events happening in the university :

- We receive quite a plenty of emails daily, of which we need to filter the mails for the organised events ( which is
  never one at a time, plenty of them are organised simultaneously or one after other) which leads to a spam of emails
  among various other information passed by the university. Too much chaos, isn’t it?

- Once we finally find and star mark the upcoming event info we received, we have to wait for any further update and
  spend a lot of concentration on that one particular event info mail from the university admin or join the whatsapp
  groups or discord channels for each individual event for every small update. I have been to 15 such different groups
  and channels already , disorganised again.

- Okay, now we are up for the event but wait, I registered for two events on the same timeline. Now what do I do? Which
  one to go for, hassle. I wish i could easily compare the timelines of the two more easily before registration.

- Now, the event is complete, I loved the way it was organised. How do I pass my feedback and compliments to the
  organising committee and let the university admin know too, that it was one of its kind event? No way, but just to
  wait for any feedback form ( if any) from the organising clubs. Again another email to look for, never mind i won’t
  give my feedback.

● Hereby, the event is complete for the students, but what about the club members and the university admin? A lot of
post event questions are:

1.)    For the club EB :

- How well was the event organised, we shall take reviews from the participants? Make and circulate a feedback form.
- Shut down the groups or discord channels made for the participants FAQ’s. New ones would be made for further events.
- Record the stats of the participation and keep it to our database.

2.)    For the university admin:

- Was the event successful? Was the organising committee able to attract the expected population?
- How well are the clubs organising events? Which club is able to organise the most successful events. Most awards for
  the clubs are solely distributed by the number of events organised by the clubs and the creativity of their event, but
  not on how well it was organised and responded by the participants. Also, some technical clubs do have their
  individual platforms for recording the participation and attendances, but many others don’t, especially non-technical
  ones. And why individual platforms when one can do it for all?

Hence, We cover these pitfalls in the event's organisation in the university. This project focuses to improve the
event's management process for the students and post event tracking for the college and club admin department. It will
also let the student post their queries for the event, and the clubs can update FAQs regarding their event for better
understanding of the participants. It provides the feature of short reviews from the participants post event and rate it
for the club to administer how their event went and keep improving with time, by addressing the issues faced by the
participants (if any). Also, it would let the university admin track the working and progress of clubs in the
university. This project holds the potential to turn around the whole event organisation/registration process in the
university, and improve the participation of students according to their interests and understanding.

## Configuring workspace

To participate and solve different tasks to let us know that you have skills enough to help us with this project, you
need to execute the following commands to set up the perfect local workspace. Before you being with the setup, it is to
be noted that you need to install [git-cli](https://git-scm.com/downloads) tool.

### Cloning the existing test project from GitHub

```shell
    $> git clone https://github.com/WSoC-VITAP/WSoC2101-TestRepo.git
```

The above command will clone or download all the files from various snapshots into the current directory from where you
run this command. This should be enough for cloning but if you want to know more about git cloning then
checkout [git cloning documentation](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone).

### Creating a new branch

Git lets you create branches and work on different branches with different versions of the same project. We want you to
create a branch so that we can recognize your work and distinguish it from other submissions.

```shell
    Command:
      $> git checkout -b <yourname_reg>
    Example:
      $> git checkout -b abc_20bce0123
```

The above command will create a new branch, and you will be automatically switched to that branch. So whatever changes
you make will be saved to the newly made branch on every commit. Now, you can start working on the given tasks but yeah
I forgot to mention that you need to run the django server first to know the tasks. Refer the following section on how
to run the server and get started with solving this test tasks by completing the most of
them. `The more you score, greater the chance you get selected to work on this project with us`.
